## Sources of Truth

| Need                       | Source                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Package catalog            | `README.md`                                                      |
| Development                | `docs/development.md`                                            |
| Package behavior and setup | `packages/*/README.md`                                           |
| Release process            | `docs/releases.md`                                               |
| Release configuration      | `release-please-config.json` and `.github/workflows/release.yml` |

## Package Constraints

- Keep each extension independent in `packages/<name>/`.
- Keep runtime TypeScript in `src/` and tests in `test/`.
- Pi loads TypeScript directly; do not add a JavaScript build step.
- Keep npm contents allowlisted with each package's `files` field.
- Do not publish tests, TypeScript configuration, Vite configuration, or workspace files.
- Put Pi-provided imports in `peerDependencies` with `"*"` ranges; put other runtime libraries in `dependencies`.

## Git Workflow

- Before starting work, fetch and prune remote refs, reconcile local and remote state, and remove completed local branches.
- Rebase work branches onto their target branch; do not merge the target branch into them.
- Never rewrite commits that are merged, tagged, released, or published.

## Pull Requests and Releases

- When asked to push changes, push the work branch and create a pull request.
- Agents must never merge pull requests; leave merging to the user.
- Do not hand-edit Release Please branches or generated release artifacts to force a release through checks.
- Do not publish npm packages, create tags or GitHub releases, or approve protected-environment deployments unless explicitly requested for the specific package and version.
- Let Release Please manage versions; keep release metadata synchronized with package manifests and npm.
